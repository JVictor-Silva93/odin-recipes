TOP project - recipes, working with HTML

Initial thoughts & intentions:
    The intent of this project is to take a hands on approach to the lessons on HTML. I am very excited and feel that it should be quite easy to apply the lessons learned from The Odin Project. 

After though & self-reflection:
    This was a fun project! Not only did it reinforce what I have learned regarding html, but also what I've learned regarding git and the command terminal.
